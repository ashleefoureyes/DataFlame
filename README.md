# DataFlame 

A hockey data tool written in Python 3.9, utilizing the Dash framework. 

## Task Status (As of Friday, November 19th)
The current revision is meant to be a UI overview. Most work done to date has been focused on data loading/handling and base UI development, so no deep analysis functionality
has been developed. 

Currently, the “Player Insight” page allows you to select any player in the dataset by filtering by team, and plots the players goals on a grid. Shot details are available
in a datatable as a placeholder, however this section will be replaced with something more aesthetic (and useful) and shot details will be available on the plot by hovering on a marker.
